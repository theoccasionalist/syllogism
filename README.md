# Syllogism

Syllogism learning system--<em>in development.</em>

A live version of the validity checker can be found here: <a> http://syllogism.herokuapp.com/syllogisms </a>

Notes on understanding the validity checker:

A propositions are of the form: All S are P.

E Propositions are of the form: No S are P.

I Propositions are of the form: Some S are P.

O Propositions are of the form: Some S are not P.


Where S is the subject, P the predicate, and M the middle term, the four figures are: 

Figure 1: M P
          S M
          S P

Figure 2: P M
          S M
          S P

Figure 3: M P
          M S
          S P
          
Figure 4: P M
          M S
          S P
          
So, for example, the following syllogism is an AAA 4:

All mammals are hairy creatures.
All hairy creatures are humans.
All humans are mammals.
